I am a highly motivated researcher driven by my deep passion and profound experience in 3D printing technology of soft matter, especially biomaterial and viscoelastic material. I am extremely determined to pursue a Ph.D. degree and become an impactful researcher in this field.

## [Research page](/research)
This page highlights my 4 years of research experience in 3D bioprinting and soft matter printing technology along with other research experience throughout my undergraduate degree at Chulalongkorn University and my Master's degree at Imperial College London. My remarkable research achievements are shown on this [Publications page](/publications).

## [projects](/projects) 
This page illustrates my proficiency in mechanical design and rapid prototyping with considerable experience in many types of 3D printing technology. I am immensely passionate about science and engineering. I consider myself a maker who loves to build engineering gadgets and understand how things work. My home workshop where I've developed a [remote 3D printing system](/projects/7) greatly boosts my progress toward these projects. <br/><br/>

Additionally, I co-founded Digitech Fabrication, a Thailand-based 3D printing startup supporting engineering research and education. More about the company can be found on this website. <br/>
