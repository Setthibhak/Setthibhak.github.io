This project is the final project of the Computer-Aided Mechanical Design course. The objective of this project is to simulate the thermal stress of a beaker caused by the sudden change in temperature and design an alternative beaker to be able to withstand the thermal shock effect. In this project, I was responsible for simulating the quantity of the thermal stress that occurred in the beaker.
