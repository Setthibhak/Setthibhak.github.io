I participated in my universityâ€™s voluntary program for renovating a remote school in Thailand. I went to Wat-Kaew-Suwan School in Ayutthaya City, to support the construction of their new agricultural greenhouse. Due to my proficiency in mechanical engineering tools, I contributed as a welding team leader, responsible for all welding and metal work of the project.
