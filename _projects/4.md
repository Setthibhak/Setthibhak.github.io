During the COVID-19 outbreak, I participated in a collaborative project between my university and external organizations to develop a very low-cost ventilator, a critical device for COVID-19 patients. This project aims to mitigate the shortage of medical equipment in hospitals. I contributed to the mechanical design and optimization of the rack and pinion mechanism, used to compress an Ambu bag.
