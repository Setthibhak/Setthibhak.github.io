date: 2020-12-01
excerpt: "Independently designed and built a multifunctional microscope in my personal laboratory. This innovative device, powered by Raspberry Pi 4B and STM32 MCUs, features automatic specimen focusing, image processing, and machine learning capabilities. I was responsible for mechanical components, optics, software development, and hardware integration.<br/><img src='/images/projects_images/5.png'>"

I have done this project individually in my own laboratory at my house. I was responsible for all mechanical parts including moving mechanism, and optics, along with the software including image processing algorithm, and machine learning. The main function of this microscope is to automatically focus the specimen, and then classify and count the number of living cells on the counting plate inserted into the machine. It is powered by Raspberry Pi 4B, STM32 MCUs, and in-house developed hardware. The machine can perform image segmentation and identify the difference between living cells and debris. It could also identify a different user by their RFID key card and report the data to the corresponding userâ€™s smartphone.
