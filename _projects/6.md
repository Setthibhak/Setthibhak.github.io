This is my final project in the Mechatronics course. The project aims to develop a temperature-controlled clean chamber for a 3D bioprinter utilizing the concept of a positive pressure chamber. The pressurized cleaned air is pumped into the clean chamber, thus not allowing the air from outside to flow into the chamber. The temperature of the air is controlled by the heating chamber where the air is pressurized before entering the clean chamber, the humidity of the air is measured in this area too. The machine reports real-time data on temperature, pressure, and humidity on the webpage interface. I was responsible for the mechanical and electrical design of the heating chamber and clean chamber. This includes the selection and installation of important sensors in the system.
