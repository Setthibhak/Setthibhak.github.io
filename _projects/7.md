excerpt: "I consider myself a maker who loves to build engineering gadgets and needs an efficient tool for rapid prototyping. Within my home workshop, I've developed a remote 3D printing system with a built-in fume control hood.<br/><br/><img src='/images/projects_images/Remote_Printer.jpg'>"

I used a Raspberry Pi microcomputer with Octoprint OS to control my FMD 3D printer remotely. This allows me to order my print from anywhere and be able to observe the process closely through live streaming. I designed and built the negative pressure fume hood from aluminum profile and acrylic sheets to control the plastic odor.
