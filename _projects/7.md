title: "3-Axis Motorized Microscope for Parasite’s Eggs Detection"
date: 2023-06-01
excerpt: "During my time as a research assistant, I got an offer from the Infectious Disease Research Laboratory, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, to participate in the development of a 3-Axis Motorized Microscope for Parasite Eggs Detection. The device is used for scanning through samples, eliminating the labor-intensive work of searching for the parasite’s egg. I was assigned to design and manufacture all mechanical and electrical hardware of this project.<br/><img src='/images/projects_images/7.png'>"
