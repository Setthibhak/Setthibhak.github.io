I'm delighted to have the opportunity to speak at SCGP, a multinational packaging solutions provider spun off from SCG, Southeast Asia's largest cement company. My talk will cover the overview of 3D printing technology, specifically the printing of paste-like materials, an area I specialize in. SCGP aims to explore innovative manufacturing processes to improve their workflow.
